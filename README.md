<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

SpectrCare takes you to mySpectrHome which is where people can share resources and give back to the underserved and underrepresented community,
and pinpoint houseless encampments or houseless people on the streets, ultimately making them feel at home because they will know the community has their full support in regaining a quality life overall.
